First, a little bit about myself. I used to just be a programmer &#45; you know &#45; write code, get the specs, write code, and go home. Later on in my career, I got the opportunity to be a quasi-leader. I came up with designs and create prototyes to push to the dev (scrum) teams to use in the product. Then I started being active in the local Agile and Product communities and this how I became acquainted with more meta-level stuff.

In a lot of large big enterprise companies, middle managers are there to help the C-level executives understand and know what's happening at the ground level.

In my experience with companies doing agile transformation, it's usually these people that feel a bit out-of-place. It's because they have no direct control on the people who are running the show, and are like peacekeepers and firefighters (I mean this metaphorically) when issues come up. They can be proactive at times, but it can sometimes cause some friction.

The LESS framework gives us an idea as to how one can deal with this - simply shift them to a role such as Product Owner, Business Analyst, or even fancier, Product Manager!

Thank you and have a wonderful day!
